![Observability Ecosystem](./slides/assets/observability_overview.jpg)
Note:
The ecosystem of monitoring and observability solutions is wide and complex. There are many possible solutions, and usually a production stack is a combination of them. 
Each solution brings it's own weakens and strengths, and the best one is usually picked by budget, familiarity, features and team knowledge.


## Logging


Should be able to collect, in a distrubuted manner, logs from different services.

Note:
Honorable mentions to Fluentd and Logstash.


Needs to store massive amounts of data, that are being streamed from our applications.

Note:
Honorable mention to ElasticSearch and bucket services.


Empowers users developers to group, analyze, and filter logs across services.

Note:
Honorable mentions to: Kibana, Stackdriver. 
Many of the commercial solutions pack all these in one bundle, like AWS CloudWatch, DataDog, HoneyComb and Graylog.
But it's important to note that you can use a combination of services specialized in each job. In fact, many of these bundles are just using them behind the scenes.


## Metrics
Ingesting, storing, querying and visualizing time-series data.

Note:
As you might have noticed, these are the same requisites of logging. The difference is just that we are not limited to text, we have a quantitative information instead of a qualitative one. These metrics are just samples collected with a predefined frequency, in contrast with logs that are always emitted. Logs crystalize past service state by stating events, and metrics represent service state across a time span.
Honorable mentions to metrics collection: Prometheus, NewRelic and Metricbeat.
Honorable mentions to metrics visualization: Grafana, NewRelic and Kibana.


## Alerting
Tracking metrics over time and notifying stakeholders if it violates a threshold.

Note: This usually consumed from either a log engine, or a metric system or both.
Honorable mentions to: Grafana, Prometheus Alertmanager and Kibana alerting.


## On-Call Rotations
Setting a rotation schedule and notifying people when things go wrong.

Note:
Honorable mentions: OpsGenie and PagerDuty.
